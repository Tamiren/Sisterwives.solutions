# Sisterwives.solutions
website/My name is Tamiren Fisher, and the official name of my project is Sisterwives.solutions. The goal of my project is to help women that are wanting to leave their polygamist lifestyle. This website is set up to provide information that women might be looking for to start over all on her own. There is also a chat room set up so women can communicate with each other and support one another. I can explain the code in great detail since I've been working on it for so long, but fortunately I didn't have to explain my code in the presentation.

	I started this project when I finished learning HTML and CSS, and then I kept adding to with every bit of new information that I learned. The website is very simple and user friendly so that if someone not familiar with computers can easily navigate through it. I learned a great deal about the polygamy lifestyle, their customs, their restrictions, and their finally jailed, child molester prophet Warren Jeffs.

	I don't know about changing the world but if it changed a few lives, I'm be over the moon about that. My target audience are sisterwives, women living in the polygamist community who want help getting out. I toned down some of the language because I learned a lot of them are allowed education only up to the eight grade. As far as marketing, I'd like to print business cards and hand them out to the women I see in the community. I'd also make sure through SEO that I'd have certain key words that women in that position might type in google if they were looking for help. I did stay professional, and I was appropriately dressed, and I knew my project pretty well so I didn't script the presentation but I felt I was more than prepared for it.
